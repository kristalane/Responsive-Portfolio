      <img src="assets/images/klanephotobyshar-copy.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Photo">

      <p>I enjoy many eclectic hobbies, a few of which pay my bills. One such passion is building and supporting communities.
      Thus far I've cultivated communities within the arts, education, and technology sectors with artists, students, faculty,
      and software professionals. People seem excited to pay me for this, which is awesome!</p>

      <p>Among other things, I am currently a University Relations Specialist at Yelp, bringing our internal engineering community
        to students at universities around the world. I began my tech career building Yelp's engineering intern program with the fine
        engineers who share my interest in education through realistic, curiosity-itching experiences. Before Yelp, I was the Program
        Manager for nonprofit dance theater company Joe Goode Performance Group and dabbled in stage management.</p>
